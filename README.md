# docker-deployments

A GitHub repository containing various `docker-compose` and `Dockerfile` along with some other scripts for deploying various applications using Docker. The `docker-compose` files can be used to define and run multi-container applications, while the `Dockerfile` files can be used to define the environment and dependencies for individual containers. The repository can be used as a reference for developers to easily spin up development, test and production environments, with specific configurations for different use cases and requirements. Depending on the project, the repository might include the following files:

* `docker-compose.yml`: The primary compose file which defines the services, networks, and volumes to be used in the deployment.
* `Dockerfile`: File containing instructions to build the image for the container.
* `.env`: File with environment variables that can be used to customize the behavior of the services defined in the docker-compose.yml.
* `.dockerignore` file: This file is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Docker when building an image.
* `.sh`: The bash file to define the complex execution plan of the docker entrypoint
* `README.md`: contains instructions on how to use the repository and information about the different deployments available.

You can find more information about docker-compose and Dockerfile on the official Docker documentation website.
