# Django

Django is a free and open-source web framework written in Python. It is designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible. Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and emphasizes reusability and "plug-ability" of components. Some of the key features of Django include its built-in admin interface, support for database migrations, and a robust, secure user authentication system. It is widely used for web development, and known for its batteries-included approach, which provides a lot of built-in functionality out of the box.

## Hello World
